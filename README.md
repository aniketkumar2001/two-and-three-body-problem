# two-body-problem
Simulating two bodies with gravitational force between them.
You can change the values of the Parameters to see the changes in the bodies' trajectories and other changes. Note that always use float dataType for the values of Parameters. Ex: If you want to set vx1 = 20, then write it as vx1 = 20.0
Each pixel corresponds to 1m*1m dimension.
