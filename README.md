## two-body-problem using pygame library
Simulating two bodies with gravitational force between them. <br>
You can change the values of the Parameters to see the changes in the bodies' trajectories and other changes. <br>
Note that always use float dataType for the values of Parameters. Ex: If you want to set vx1 = 20, then write it as vx1 = 20.0 <br>
Each pixel corresponds to 1m*1m dimension.

## Spaceship Controls
The orbiting object in spaceship.py is our spaceship. We can control its thrust, try pressing W,S,A,D. <br>
Thrust value can be changed by UP and DOWN Keys <br>
The front of the spaceship is always in the direction of its motion. To give a thrust from behind press W, from front S and A for left, D for right. <br>
One can give thrust in any direction by pressing SPACE, note that the direction of this thrust will be in the direction away from your mouse cursor on the screen.
